# Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration. The installed plugins are

1. Packer
2. Telescope
3. Onedark colorscheme
4. Treesitter
5. Fugitive Git Wrapper
6. LSP-Zero

To get started, first install Packer, which is the plugin installer. Install it from the bash script `packer_install.sh` in the root folder. A round of packer Sync should do the trick then, within nvim.
